## Project Overview
The Manufacturing – IoT Predictive Maintenance Engine is a machine learning–based system designed to predict machine failures in advance using time-series IoT sensor data.

## Problem Statement
Unexpected machine failures in manufacturing industries cause downtime, financial loss, and maintenance challenges. Traditional maintenance methods are inefficient and reactive.

## Solution
This project uses IoT sensor data such as temperature, vibration, and pressure along with machine learning techniques to predict machine failure before it occurs.

## Dataset
- Type: Synthetic time-series IoT dataset
- Features: Temperature, Vibration, Pressure
- Target: Failure (0 = Normal, 1 = Failure)

## Modules Implemented
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Baseline Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Final Model (XGBoost)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Project Status
In Progress
